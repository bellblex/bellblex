## Interests

Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, gaming, binge-watching series, and drawing. My curiosity often leads me to exciting side projects, like building a home server from old laptop and computer parts. Staying active is important to me too—I enjoy playing futsal and swimming, with a history of federated competitions in both.
